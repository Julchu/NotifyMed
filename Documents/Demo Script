Hi, my name is Julian, and my partner's name is Dan

We built an app called NotifyMed to help medical patients with poor memory by reminding them to take their medication. 

Through some personal research, we found that a lot of elderly patients struggled with two problems. Some of them would forget that they have a prescribed medication to take. Others would forget if they've taken their prescription for the day. 

Our app helps solve these problems by allowing patients to schedule medical notifications and record audio memos to track if they've taken their prescribed medication.

// Switch to app and click add button
The main view of the app will display all ongoing reminders. Clicking the add button opens the view to add a reminder. 
    // Add label
	- User must add a reminder label, such as the name of their medicine
	- They can also choose the frequency of which the reminders will occur throughout the week, as well as the weekly frequency and start and end dates
    // Save reminder
	- For the purpose of demonstrating the notifications, I have set the reminders to occur immediately after saving

// Click reminder
Users can also click on a reminder to view or edit their reminder, as well as record or listen to their audio memo. 
	- Editing the reminders will update the occurrences of their notifications.
	- Recording a memo will save it to that specific reminder
    // Record memo: "I have taken Tylenol on April 21, 2020"

// Click back, and delete reminder
When users are done with their prescription, they will be able to delete their reminders, which will remove the notifications set by the reminder, as well as the audio recording. 

Hopefully with this app, medical patients who usually forget if they've taken their medication will not miss another day's medication with NotifyMed
