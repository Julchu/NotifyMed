## Inspiration
  - Medical patients sometimes struggle with forgetfulness and don't remember taking their routinely medication
  
## What it does
- This solution allows users to enter reminders that will periodically send alerts throughout the day
- Users can only dismiss the reminders by creating an audio recording acknowledging that they've taken the medication
- The app will also keep track of the days a reminder has been dismissed or missed

## How I built it
- Swift 5, XCode, VMWare, Hackintosh, a lot of Googling about setting up a MacOS environment and Swift

## Challenges I ran into
- Setting up an environment to develop on as a PC user; VMWare MacOS workaround, Hackintosh (MacOS on desktop PC)
- Creating the visual calendar to track the dismissal or miss of a reminder
- Storing the audio recording for each reminder

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- Learning about Swift 5, being able to design and transform MVCs into a real product
- Building a solution to a problem that I personally suffer from
- Learning and developing in a technology (iOS) that I've always been interested in learning

## Not working:
- Notification start and end date
- Removal of behavior where notification restarts at app restart

## Next step:
- Implement automatically dismissed reminders based on recorded memo
- Implement removed reminders
- Calendar interface
- Online storage system
- Create a companion app for medical practitioners/caretakers to track their patients' reminders
- Rebuild in React Native
- Android alternative
